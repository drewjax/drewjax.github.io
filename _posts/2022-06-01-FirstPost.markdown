This is my first blog post on github pages using Jekyll. This is my first github pages experience so for the most part it has been a little tricky (which im sure my future self will surely be dissapointed about).

My plan for this blog is to just document my journey. I still consider myself a novice at coding and I want to see my progressions. At the current time I am in the job hunt, so thats where this will start. I will document some of my leetcode problems and applications. This will surely help me stay motivated and have topics to talk about. 

Meanwhile this is a tweet I saw this afternoon from [RapidApi][api-tweet] that I thought explained authentication of API well. 

I currently had just graduated college for my undergraduate degree in computer science and now have all this time on my hands. For my capstone project I had learned a little Git, so I used that knowledge in order to deploy this project which is cool. I also get to experience it on my own and try out new things. I learned through a neat lab from [Git-Immersion][git] that goes into great detail which was very helpful.

Stay tuned for more Drew!
